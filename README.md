## SQL Advanced Module Task
Task Description (Completed Work)

Collected and consolidated data to analyze account creation trends, user engagement with emails (including sends, opens, and clicks), and user behavior across key categories such as send intervals, account verification, and subscription status. The dataset enables cross-country activity comparisons, identification of key markets, and segmentation of users based on various behavioral and demographic parameters.

## Python for DA Module Task 
Project Overview

This project involved analyzing a global company's sales dataset, which includes transactions from both offline stores and online channels. The goal was to clean, process, and analyze the data to extract valuable business insights.
The dataset consists of three tables:
events.csv — sales transactions over multiple years
products.csv — product categories and their codes
countries.csv — country and region information with corresponding codes
The main objective was to clean the data and perform a comprehensive analysis to uncover key performance metrics and actionable insights for the business.

Project Workflow
1. Data Overview
Loaded and explored the datasets to understand column contents, data types, and structure.
Identified key fields for merging the three tables.
Created initial descriptive statistics to summarize data coverage and distribution.

2. Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values in each table, assessed their proportion, and investigated potential causes.
Imputed or removed missing values with proper justification.
Verified and corrected data types where necessary (e.g., converting date columns to datetime format).
Detected and handled duplicates, considering whitespace, letter casing, and potential Cyrillic/Latin character inconsistencies.
Investigated anomalies and outliers in the data to ensure reliability for analysis.

3. Data Analysis and Visualization
Merged the three tables into a single dataframe and removed unnecessary columns for analysis.
Renamed columns where needed for clarity.
Key metrics calculated and visualized include:
Total number of orders
Total profit and revenue
Average order value
Total units sold
Number of countries and regions covered
Average shipping duration
Other custom KPIs relevant to business performance
Analysis performed across multiple dimensions:
Product Categories: revenue, costs, profit, popularity
Geography: performance by country and region
Sales Channels: online vs offline
Shipping Duration: analysis of time between order and shipment by product category, country, and region
Profit Dependency: examined whether profit correlates with shipping duration
Time Dynamics: analyzed sales trends over time by category, country, and region
Day-of-Week Analysis: identified patterns in sales by day of the week
Seasonality: evaluated potential seasonal trends in product sales using heatmaps

4. Reporting
Compiled a detailed report in Google Colab, including:
Fully documented code
Interactive and static visualizations
Business-focused explanations and insights
Generated actionable conclusions to guide decision-making in sales, marketing, and logistics.
Key Deliverables
Google Colab notebook with cleaned datasets, analysis, visualizations, and explanations
Business insights summary highlighting top product categories, key markets, profitable channels, shipping patterns, and seasonal trends
Interactive charts and heatmaps for clear representation of sales performance and trends

This project demonstrates end-to-end Data Analytics skills, including data cleaning, transformation, analysis, visualization, and reporting, suitable for showcasing in a portfolio or resume.
